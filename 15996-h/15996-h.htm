<h2>NOTES.</h2>


<h3>PRESENCE OF STRANGERS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.</h3>


<p>In the late debate on Mr. Grantley Berkeley's
motion for a fixed duty on corn, Sir Benjamin
Hall is reported to have imagined the presence of
a stranger to witness the debate, and to have said
that he was imagining what every one knew the
rules of the House rendered an impossibility. It
is strange that so intelligent a member of the
House of Commons should be ignorant of the fact
that the old sessional orders, which absolutely
prohibited the presence of strangers in the House
of Commons, were abandoned in 1845, and that a
standing order now exists in their place which
recognises and regulates their presence. The
insertion of this "note" may prevent many
"queries" in after times, when the sayings and
doings of 1850 have become matters of antiquarian discussion.</p>

<p>The following standing orders were made by
the House of Commons on the 5th of February,
1845, on the motion of Mr. Christie, (see Hansard,
and Commons' Journals of that day), and superseded
the old sessional orders, which purported
to exclude strangers entirely from the House of Commons:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That the serjeant at arms attending this House do
from time to time take into his custody any stranger
whom he may see, or who may be reported to him to
be, in any part of the House or gallery appropriated to
the members of this House; and also any stranger
who, having been admitted into any other part of the
House or gallery, shall misconduct himself, or shall
not withdraw when strangers are directed to withdraw
while the House, or any committee of the whole House,
is sitting; and that no person so taken into custody
be discharged out of custody without the special order of the House.</p>

<p>"That no member of this House do presume to
bring any stranger into any part of the House or gallery
appropriated to the members of this House while
the House, or a committee of the whole House, is sitting."</p>

<p>Now, therefore, strangers are only liable to be
taken into custody if in a part of the House appropriated
to members, or misconducting themselves,
or refusing to withdraw when ordered by
the Speaker to do so; and Sir Benjamin Hall imagined no impossibility.</p>

<h3>THE AGAPEMONE.</h3>


<p>Like most other things, the "Agapemone"
wickedness, which has recently disgusted all decent
people, does not appear to be a new thing by
any means. The religion-mongers of the nineteenth
century have a precedent nearly 300 years old for this house of evil repute.</p>

<p>In the reign of Elizabeth, the following proclamation
was issued against "The Sectaries of the Family of Love:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whereas, by report of sundry of the Bishops of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>{18}</span>
this Realm, and others having care of souls, the Queen's
Majesty is informed, that in sundry places of her said
Realm, in their several Dioceses there are certain
persons which do secretly, in corners, make privy assemblies
of divers simple unlearned people, and after
they have craftily and hypocritically allured them to
esteem them to be more holy and perfect men than
other are, they do then teach them damnable heresies,
directly contrary to divers of the principal Articles of our
Belief and Christian Faith and in some parts so absurd
and fanatical, as by feigning to themselves a monstrous
new kind of speech, never found in the Scriptures,
nor in ancient Father or writer of Christ's Church, by
which they do move ignorant and simple people at the
first rather to marvel at them, than to understand them
but yet to colour their sect withal, they name themselves
to be of the <i>Family of Love</i>, and then as many as
shall be allowed by them to be of that family to be
elect and saved, and all others, of what Church soever
they be, to be rejected and damned. And for that
upon conventing of some of them before the Bishops
and Ordinaries, it is found that the ground of their sect,
is maintained by certain lewd, heretical, and seditious
books first made in the Dutch tongue, and lately translated
into English, and printed beyond the seas, and
secretly brought over into the Realm, the author
whereof they name H.N., without yielding to him,
upon their examination, any other name, in whose
name they have certain books set forth, called <i>Evangelium
Regni, or, A Joyful Message of the Kingdom;
Documental Sentences, The Prophecie of the Spirit of
Love; a Publishing of the Peace upon the Earth</i>, and such like.</p>

<p>"And considering also it is found, that these Sectaries
hold opinion, that they may before any magistrate,
ecclesiastical or temporal, or any other person not
being professed to be of their sect (which they term
the Family of Love), by oath or otherwise deny any
thing for their advantage, so as though many of them
are well known to be teachers and spreaders abroad of
these dangerous and damnable sects, yet by their own
confession they cannot be condemned, whereby they are
more dangerous in any Christian Realm: Therefore,
her Majesty being very sorry to see so great an evil by
the malice of the Devil, first begun and practised in
other countries, to be now brought into this her
Realm, and that by her Bishops and Ordinaries she
understandeth it very requisite, not only to have these
dangerous Heretics and Sectaries to be severely punished,
but that also all other means be used by her
Majesty's Royal authority, which is given her of God
to defend Christ's Church, to root them out from further
infecting her Realm, she hath thought meet and
convenient, and so by this her Proclamation she willeth
and commandeth, that all her Officers and Ministers
temporal shall, in all their several vocations, assist the
Archbishops and Bishops of her Realm, and all other
persons ecclesiastical, having care of souls, to search
out all persons duly suspected to be either teachers or
professors of the foresaid damnable sects, and by all
good means to proceed severely against them being
found culpable, by order of the Laws either ecclesiastical
or temporal: and that, also, search be made in
all places suspected, for the books and writings maintaining
the said Heresies and Sects, and them to destroy and burn.</p>

<p>"And wheresoever such Books shall be found after
the publication hereof, in custody of any person, other
than such as the Ordinaries shall permit, to the intent
to peruse the same for confutation thereof, the same
persons to be attached and committed to close prison,
there to remain, or otherwise by Law to be condemned,
until the same shall be purged and cleared of the same
heresies, or shall recant the same, and be thought meet
by the Ordinary of the place to be delivered. And
that whoever in this Realm shall either print, or bring,
or cause to be brought into this Realm, any of the said
Books, the same persons to be attached and committed
to prison, and to receive such bodily punishment and
other mulct as fautors of damnable heresies. And to
the execution hereof, her Majesty chargeth all her
Officers and Ministers, both ecclesiastical and temporal,
to have special regard, as they will answer not
only afore God, whose glory and truth is by these
damnable Sects greatly sought to be defaced, but also
will avoid her Majesty's indignation, which in such
cases as these are, they ought not to escape, if they
shall be found negligent and careless in the execution of their authorities.</p>

<p>"Given at our Mannour of Richmond, the third of
October, in the two-and-twentieth year of our Reign.</p>

<p>"God Save The Queen."</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>


<p><i>Divination by Bible and Key</i> seems not merely
confined to this country, but to prevail in Asia.
The following passage from <i>Pérégrinations en
Orient</i>, par Eusèbe de Salle, vol. i. p. 167., Paris,
1840, may throw some additional light on this
superstition. The author is speaking of his sojourn
at Antioch, in the house of the <i>English</i> consul.</p>

<p>"En rentrant dans le salon, je trouvai Mistriss B.
assise sur son divan, près d'un natif Syrien Chrétien.
Ils tenaient à eux deux une Bible, suspendue à une grosse
clé par un mouchoir fin. Mistriss B. ne se rappelait
pas avoir reçu un bijou qu'un Aleppin affirmait lui
avoir remis. Le Syrien disait une prière, puis prononçait
alternativement les noms de la dame et de l'Aleppin.
La Bible pivota au nom de la dame déclarée par-là en
erreur. Elle se leva à l'instant, et ayant fait des recherches
plus exactes, finit par trouver le bijou."</p>

<p>I hardly think that this would be an English
superstition transplanted to the East; it is more
probable that it was originally derived frown Syria.</p>

<p><i>Charm for Warts</i>.&mdash;Count most carefully the
number of warts; take a corresponding number of
nodules or knots from the stalks of any of the
<i>cerealia</i> (wheat, oats, barley); wrap these in a
cloth, and deposit the packet in the earth; <i>all the
steps of the operation being done secretly</i>. As the
nodules decay the warts will disappear. Some
artists think it necessary that each wart should be
<i>touched</i> by a separate nodule.</p>

<p>This practice was very rife in the north of
Scotland some fifty years since, and no doubt is
so still. It was regarded as very effective, and
certainly had plenty of evidence of the <i>post-hoc-ergo-propter-hoc</i>
order in its favour.</p>

<p>Is this practice prevalent in England?</p>

<p>It will be remarked that this belongs to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>{20}</span>
category of <i>Vicarious Charms</i>, which have in all
times and in all ages, in great things and in small
things, been one of the favourite resources of poor
mortals in their difficulties. Such charms (for all
analogous practices may be so called) are, in point
of fact, <i>sacrifices</i> made on the principle so widely
adopted,&mdash;<i>qui facit per alium facit per se</i>. The
common witch-charm of melting an image of wax
stuck full of pins before a slow fire, is a familiar
instance. Everybody knows that the party <i>imaged</i>
by the wax continues to suffer all the tortures of
pin-pricking until he or she finally melts away
(colliquescit), or dies in utter emaciation.</p>

<p><i>Boy or Girl.</i>&mdash;The following mode was adopted
a few years ago in a branch of my family residing
in Denbighshire, with the view of discovering the
sex of an infant previous to its birth. As I do not
remember to have met with it in other localities,
it may, perhaps, be an interesting addition to your
"Folk Lore." An old woman of the village,
strongly attached to the family, asked permission
to use a harmless charm to learn if the expected
infant would be male or female. Accordingly she
joined the servants at their supper, where she
assisted in clearing a shoulder of mutton of every
particle of meat. She then held the blade-bone
to the fire until it was scorched, so as to permit
her to force her thumbs through the thin part.
Through the holes thus made she passed a string,
and having knotted the ends together, she drove
in a nail over the back door and left the house,
giving strict injunctions to the servants to hang
the bone up in that place the last thing at night.
Then they were carefully to observe who should
first enter that door on the following morning,
exclusive of the members of the household, and the
sex of the child would be that of the first comer.
This rather vexed some of the servants, who wished
for a boy, as two or three women came regularly
each morning to the house, and a man was scarcely
ever seen there; but to their delight the first
comer on this occasion proved to be a man, and in
a few weeks the old woman's reputation was established
throughout the neighbourhood by the birth of a boy.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>


<h4>POET LAUREATES.</h4>

<p>Can any of the contributors to your most useful
"NOTES AND QUERIES" favour me with the title
of any work which gives an account of the origin,
office, emoluments, and privileges of Poet Laureate.
Selden, in his <i>Titles of Honour (Works</i>,
vol. iii. p. 451.), shows the Counts Palatine had
the right of conferring the dignity claimed by the
German Emperors. The first payment I am
aware of is to Master Henry de Abrinces, the
<i>Versifier</i> (I suppose Poet Laureate), who received
6<i>d.</i> a day,&mdash;4<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i>, as will be seen in the <i>Issue Roll</i>
of Thomas de Brantingham, edited by Frederick Devon.</p>

<p>Warton (<i>History of English Poetry</i>, vol. ii.
p. 129.) gives no further information, and is the
author generally quoted; but the particular matter sought for is wanting.</p>

<p>The first patent, according to the <i>Encyclopædia
Metropolitana</i>, article "Laureate," is stated, as regards
the existing office, to date from 5th Charles I.,
1630; and assigns as the annual gratuity 100<i>l.</i>,
and a tierce of Spanish Canary wine out of the royal cellars.</p>

<p>Prior to this, the emoluments appear uncertain,
as will be seen by Gifford's statement relative to
the amount paid to B. Jonson, vol. i. cxi.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Hitherto the Laureateship appears to have been a
mere trifle, adopted at pleasure by those who were employed
to write for the court, but conveying no privileges,
and establishing no claim to a salary."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I am inclined to doubt the accuracy of the
phrase "employed to write for the court." Certain
it is, the question I now raise was <i>pressed</i>
then, as it was to satisfy Ben Jonson's want of
information Selden wrote on the subject in his <i>Titles of Honour</i>.</p>

<p>These emoluments, rights, and privileges have
been matters of Laureate dispute, even to the
days of Southey. In volume iv. of his correspondence,
many hints of this will be found; <i>e.g.</i>,
at page 310., with reference to Gifford's statement, and "my proper rights."</p>

<p>The Abbé Resnel says,&mdash;"L'illustre Dryden l'a
porté comme <i>Poète du Roy</i>," which rather reduces its
academic dignity; and adds, "Le Sieur Cyber, comédien
de profession, est actuellement en possession du
titre de Poète Lauréate, et qu'il jouit en même tems
de deux cens livres sterling de pension, à la charge de
présenter tous les ans, deux pièces de vers à la famille royale."</p>

<p>I am afraid, however, the Abbé drew upon his
imagination for the amount of the salary; and
that he would find the people were never so hostile
to the court as to sanction so heavy an infliction
upon the royal family, as they would have
met with from the quit-rent ode, the peppercorn
of praise paid by Elkanah Settle, Cibber, or H.J. Pye.</p>

<p>The Abbé, however, is not so amusing in his
mistake (if mistaken) relative to this point, as I
find another foreign author has been upon two
Poet Laureates, Dryden and Settle. Vincenzo
Lancetti, in his <i>Pseudonimia Milano</i>, 1836, tells us:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Anche la durezza di alcuni cognomi ha più volte
consigliato un raddolcimento, che li rendesse più facili
a pronunziarsi. Percio Macloughlin divenne Macklin;
Machloch, Mallet; ed Elkana Settle fu poi &mdash;&mdash;
John Dryden!"
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Wood Paper</i>.&mdash;The reprint of the <i>Works of
Bishop Wilkins</i>, London, 1802, 2 vols. 8vo., is said
to be on paper made from wood pulp. It has all
the appearance of it in roughness, thickness, and
very unequal opacity. Any sheet looked at with
a candle behind it is like a firmament scattered
with luminous nebulæ. I can find mention of
straw paper, as patented about the time; but I
should think it almost impossible (knowing how
light the Indian rice paper is) that the heavy
fabric above mentioned should be of straw. Is it
from wood? If so, what is the history of the invention,
and what other works were printed in it?</p>

<p><i>Rome, Ancient and Modern</i>.&mdash;I observed, in a
shop in Rome, in 1847, a large plan of that city,
in which, on the same surface, both ancient and
modern Rome were represented; the shading of
the streets and buildings being such as to distinguish
the one from the other. Thus, in looking at
the modern Forum, you saw, as it were <i>underneath</i>
it, the ancient Forum; and so in the other parts of
the city. Can any of your readers inform me as
to the name of the designer, and where, if at all,
in England, a copy of this plan may be obtained?</p>

<p>If I remember rightly, the border to the plan
was composed of the Pianta Capitolina, or fragments

churches, St. John's and St. Mary's, not much inferior
to the best of our cathedrals. Here a very old woman

who had belonged to the church a hundred years."

the language spoken in <i>Queen Mary's</i> days, and
what peculiarity distinguished it from the language used in <i>Evelyn's</i> days?</p>

arose from the slow progress in social improvement in the North of England, caused by the difficulty of communication with the court
and its refinements. I am still anxious to ascertain what the difference was.</p>

"This is a singular word, which occurs, however
both to the north and south of the Ribble, though
much more frequently to the north. To the south, I
know not that it occurs, but in Angles-ark and Brettargh.
To the north are Battarghes, Ergh-holme,
Stras-ergh, Sir-ergh, Feiz-er, Goosen-ergh. In all the
Teutonic dialects I meet with nothing resembling this
word, <i>excepting the Swedish</i> Arf, <i>terra</i> (<i>vide</i> Ihre <i>in

is precisely the same with <i>argh</i>."

<p><i>Burial Service</i>.&mdash;During a conversation on the
various sanitary measures now projecting in the
metropolis, and particularly on the idea lately
started of re-introducing the ancient practice of
burning the bodies of the deceased, one of our
company remarked that the words "ashes to ashes,"
used in our present form of burial, would in such
a case be literally applicable; and a question arose
why the word "ashes" should have been introduced
at all, and whether its introduction might
not have been owing to the actual cremation of the
funeral pyre at the burial of Gentile Christians?
We were none of us profound enough to quote or
produce any facts from the monuments and records
of the early converts to account for the expression;
but I conceive it probable that a solution could be
readily given by some of your learned correspondents.
The burning of the dead does not
appear to be in itself an anti-christian ceremony,
nor necessarily connected with Pagan idolatries,
and therefore might have been tolerated in the
case of Gentile believers like any other indifferent usage.</p>

there were curates of prisons, that we might say, the
'curate of Newgate, the curate of the Fleet,' and I

in November, 1645, and after passing some time
in France, to have gone into the Netherlands, where
he obtained a commission as Lieutenant-General
in the Spanish army. Lodge adds, upon the
authority of Dugdale, that he closed his singular
life in that country, in the character of a Dominican
friar, and his father surviving him, he never
became Earl of Norwich. A recent publication,
speaking of Lord Goring, says he carried his
genius, his courage, and his villainy to market on
the Continent, served under Spain, and finally
assumed the garb of a Dominican friar, and died in a convent cell.</p>

<h2>Replies.</h2>


<h4>DERIVATION OF "NEWS" AND "NOISE."</h4>

<p>I hasten to repudiate a title to which I have no
claim; a compliment towards the close of the
letter of your correspondent "CH." (Vol. i., p. 487.)
being evidently intended for a gentleman whose
<i>christian</i> name, only, <i>differs</i> from mine. The compliment
in his case is well-deserved; and it will
not lower him in your correspondent's opinion, to
know that he is not answerable for the sins laid
to my charge. And now for a word in my own behalf.</p>

<p>Indeed, CH. is rather hard upon me, I must
confess. In using the simple form of assertion as
more convenient,&mdash;although I intended thereby
merely to express that such was my opinion, and
not dreaming of myself as an authority,&mdash;I have
undoubtedly erred. In the single instance in
which I used it, instead of saying "it is," I should
have said "I think it is." Throughout the rest of
my argument I think the terms made use of are
perfectly allowable as expressions of opinion.
Your correspondent has been good enough to give
"the whole" of my "argument" in recapitulating
my "assertions." Singular dogmatism that in
laying down the law should condescend to give
reasons for it! On the other hand, when I turn to
the letter of my friendly censor, I find assertion
without argument, which, to my simple apprehension,
is of much nearer kin to dogmatism than is the sin with which I am charged.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that your correspondent,
from his dislike "to be puzzled on so plain a subject,"
has a misapprehension as to the uses of
etymology. I, too, am no etymologist; I am a
simple inquirer, anxious for information; frequently,
without doubt, "most ignorant" of what
I am "most assured;" yet I feel that to treat the
subject scientifically it is not enough to guess at
the origin of a word, not enough even to know it;
that it is important to know not only whence it
came, but how it came, what were its relations, by
what road it travelled; and treated thus, etymology
is of importance, as a branch of a larger science,
to the history of the progress of the human race.</p>

<p>Descending now to particulars, let your correspondent
show me how "news" was made out of
"new." I have shown him how <i>I think</i> it was made; but I am open to conviction.</p>

<p>I repeat my opinion that "news is a noun singular,
and as such must have been adopted bodily
into the language;" and if it were a "noun of
plural form and plural meaning," I still think
that the singular form must have preceded it.
The two instances CH. gives, "goods" and
"riches," are more in point than he appears to
suppose, although in support of my argument, and
not his. The first is from the Gothic, and is substantially
a word implying "possessions," older
than the oldest European living languages.
"Riches" is most unquestionably in its original
acceptation in our language a noun singular, being
identically the French "richesse," in which manner
it is spelt in our early writers. From the form
coinciding with that of our plural, it has acquired
also a plural signification. But both words "have
been adopted bodily into the language," and thus
strengthen my argument that the process of manufacture is with us unknown.</p>

<p>Your correspondent is not quite correct in describing
me as putting forward as instances of the
early communication between the English and the
German languages the derivation of "news" from
"Neues," and the similarity between two poems.
The first I adduced as an instance of the importance
of the inquiry: with regard to the second,
I admitted all that your correspondent now says;
but with the remark, that the mode of treatment
and the measure approaching so near to each
other in England and Germany within one half
century (and, I may add, at no other period in
either of the two nations is the same mode or
measure to be found), there was reasonable ground
for suspicion of direct or indirect communication.
On this subject I asked for information.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I think I observe something of a
sarcastic tone in reference to my "novelty." I
shall advocate nothing that I do not believe to be
true, "whether it be old or new;" but I have
found that our authorities are sometimes careless,
sometimes unfaithful, and are so given to run in
a groove, that when I am in quest of truth I
generally discard them altogether, and explore, however laboriously, by myself.</p>

<p>St. John's Wood, May 27. 1850.</p>


<p>I do not know the reason for the rule your
correspondent Mr. S. HICKSON lays down, that
such a noun as "news" could not be formed
according to English analogy. Why not as well
as "goods, the shallows, blacks, for mourning,
greens?" There is no singular to any of these as nouns.</p>

<p><i>Noise</i> is a French word, upon which Menage
has an article. There can be no doubt that he
and others whom he quotes are right, that it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>{24}</span>
derived from <i>noxa</i> or <i>noxia</i> in Latin, meaning "strife." They quote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Sæpe in conjugiis fit noxia, cum nimia est dos."</p>
<p class="author"><i>Ausonius</i>.</p>

<p>"Diligerent alia, et noxas bellumque moverent."</p>
<p class="author"><i>Manilius</i>.</p>
  </div>  </div>


<p>It is a great pity that we have no book of
reference for English analogy of language.</p>

<p class="author">C.B.</p>


<p>Why should Mr. Hickson (Vol. i., p. 428.)
attempt to derive "news" indirectly from a German
adjective, when it is so directly attributable
to an English one; and that too without departing
from a practice almost indigenous in the language?</p>

<p>Have we not in English many similar adjective
substantives? Are we not continually slipping
into our <i>shorts</i>, or sporting our <i>tights</i>, or parading
our <i>heavies</i>, or counter-marching our <i>lights</i>, or
commiserating <i>blacks</i>, or leaving <i>whites</i> to starve;
or calculating the <i>odds</i>, or making <i>expositions</i> for <i>goods</i>?</p>

<p>Oh! but, says Mr. Hickson, "in that case
the '<i>s</i>' would be the sign of the plural." Not
necessarily so, no more than an "<i>s</i>" to "mean"
furnishes a "means" of proving the same thing.
But granting that it were so, what then? The
word "news" <i>is</i> undoubtedly plural, and has been
so used from the earliest times; as (in the example
I sent for publication last week, of so early
a date as the commencement of Henry VIII.'s
reign) may be seen in "<i>thies</i> new<i>es</i>."</p>

<p>But a flight still more eccentric would be the
identification of "noise" with "news!" "There
is no process," Mr. Hickson says, "by which noise
could be manufactured without making a plural noun of it!"</p>

<p>Is not Mr. Hickson aware that <i>la noise</i> is a
French noun-singular signifying a contention or
dispute? and that the same word exists in the Latin <i>nisus</i>, a struggle?</p>

<p>If mere plausibility be sufficient ground to justify
a derivation, where is there a more plausible
one than that "news," <i>intelligence, ought</i> to be derived
from &nu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;, <i>understanding</i> or <i>common sense</i>?</p>

<h4>THE DODO QUERIES.</h4>

<p>I beg to thank Mr. S.W. Singer for the further
notices he has given (Vol. i., p. 485.) in connection
with this subject. I was well acquainted with
the passage which he quotes from Osorio, a passage
which some writers have very inconsiderately
connected with the Dodo history. In reply to
Mr. Singer's Queries, I need only make the following
extract from the <i>Dodo and its Kindred</i>, p. 8.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The statement that Vasco de Gama, in 1497, discovered,
sixty leagues beyond the Cape of Good Hope,
a bay called after San Blaz, near an island full of birds
with wings like bats, which the sailors called <i>solitaries</i>
(De Blainville, <i>Nouv. Ann. Mus. Hist. Nat.</i>, and <i>Penny
Cyclopædia</i>, DODO, p. 47.), is wholly irrelevant. The
birds are evidently penguins, and their wings were
compared to those of bats, from being without developed
feathers. De Gama never went near Mauritius,
but hugged the African coast as far as Melinda, and
then crossed to India, returning by the same route.
This small island inhabited by penguins, near the Cape
of Good Hope, has been gratuitously confounded with
Mauritius. Dr. Hamel, in a memoir in the <i>Bulletin
de la Classe Physico-Mathématique de l'Académie de
St. Petersbourg</i>, vol. iv. p. 53., has devoted an unnecessary
amount of erudition to the refutation of this obvious
mistake. He shows that the name <i>solitaires</i>, as
applied to penguins by De Gama's companions, [I
should have said, 'by later compilers,'] is corrupted
from <i>sotilicairos</i>, which appears to be a Hottentot
word."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I may add, that Dr. Hamel shows Osorio's statement
to be taken from Castanheda, who is the
earliest authority for the account of De Gama's voyage.</p>

<h4>BOHN'S EDITION OF MILTON.</h4>

<p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;I have just seen an article in
your "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" referring to my
edition of Milton's prose works. It is stated that,
in my latest catalogue, the book is announced as
<i>complete</i> in 3 vols., although the contrary appears
to be the case, judging by the way in which the
third volume ends, the absence of an index, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In reply, I beg to say that the insertion of the
word "complete," in some of my catalogues, has
taken place without my privity, and is now expunged.
The fourth volume has long been in
preparation, but the time of its appearance depends
on the health and leisure of a prelate, whose name
I have no right to announce. Those gentlemen
who have taken the trouble to make direct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>{25}</span>

<h4>UMBRELLAS.</h4>

<p>Although Dr. Rimbault's Query (Vol. i., p. 415.)
as to the first introduction of umbrellas into
England, is to a certain extent answered in the
following number (p. 436.) by a quotation from
Mr. Cunningham's <i>Handbook</i>, a few additional
remarks may, perhaps, be deemed admissible.
Hanway is there stated to have been "the first
man who ventured to walk the streets of London
with one over his head," and that after continuing
its use nearly thirty years, he saw them come into
general use. As Hanway died in 1786, we may
thus infer that the introduction of umbrellas may
be placed at about 1750. But it is, I think, probable
that their use must have been at least partially
known in London long before that period,
judging from the following extract from Gay's
<i>Trivia, or Art of Walking the Streets of London</i>, published 1712:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Good housewives all the winter's rage despise,</p>
<p>Defended by the ridinghood's disguise;</p>
<p>Or, underneath th' <i>umbrella's</i> oily shade,</p>
<p>Safe through the wet on clinking pattens tread.</p>
<p>Let Persian dames the <i>umbrella's</i> ribs display,</p>
<p>To guard their beauties from the sunny ray;</p>
<p>Or sweating slaves support the shady load,</p>
<p>When Eastern monarchs show their state abroad;</p>
<p>Britain in winter only knows its aid,</p>
<p>To guard from chilly showers the walking maid."</p>
<p class="author">Book i. lines 209-218.</p>
  </div>  </div>


<p>That it was, perhaps, an article of curiosity
rather than use in the middle of the seventeenth
century, is evident in the fact of its being mentioned
in the "<i>Musæum Tradescantianum, or Collection
of Rarities</i>, preserved at South Lambeth
near London, by John Tradescant." 12mo. 1656.
It occurs under the head of "Utensils," and is
simply mentioned as "<i>An Umbrella</i>."</p>

[Mr. St. Croix has also referred Dr. Rimbault to Gay's <i>Trivia</i>.]

<p>Jonas Hanway the philanthropist is reputed
first to have used an "umbrella" in England. I
am the more inclined to think it may be so, as my
own father, who was born in 1744, and lived to
ninety-two years of age, has told me the same thing,
and he lived in the same parish as Mr. Hanway, who resided in Red Lion Square.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanway was born in 1712.</p>

<p class="author">J.W.</p>


<p>The introduction of this article of general convenience
is attributed, and I believe accurately so,
to Jonas Hanway, the Eastern traveller, who on
his return to his native land rendered himself
justly celebrated by his practical benevolence. In
a little book with a long title, published in 1787,
written by "<i>John Pugh</i>," I find many curious
anecdotes related of Hanway, and apropos of umbrellas,
in describing his dress Mr. Pugh says,&mdash;"When
it rained, a small parapluie defended his
face and wig; thus he was always prepared to
enter into any company without impropriety, or
the appearance of neglect. And he (Hanway)
was the first man who ventured to walk the streets
of London with an umbrella over his head: after
carrying one near thirty years, he saw them come
into general use." Hanway died 1786.</p>

<p class="author">J.F.</p>


<p>As far as I remember, there is a portrait of
Hanway with an umbrella as a frontispiece to the
book of Travels published by him about 1753, in
four vols. 4to.; and I have no doubt that he had
used one in his travels through Greece, Turkey, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="author">T.G.L.</p>


<p>In the hall of my father's house, at Stamford in
Lincolnshire, there was, when I was a child, the
wreck of a very large green silk umbrella, apparently
of Chinese manufacture, brought by my
father from Holland, somewhere between 1770
and 1780, and as I have often heard, the first umbrella
seen at Stamford. I well remember also an
amusing description given by the late Mr. Warry,
so many years consul at Smyrna, of the astonishment
and envy of his mother's neighbours at Sawbridgeworth,
in Herts, where his father had a
country-house, when he ran home and came back
with an umbrella, which he had just brought from
Leghorn, to shelter them from a pelting shower
which detained them in the church-porch, after the
service, on one summer Sunday. From Mr. Warry's
age at the time he mentioned this, and other circumstances
in his history, I conjecture that it
occurred not later than 1775 or 1776. As Sawbridgeworth
is so near London, it is evident that
even there umbrellas were at that time almost unknown.</p>

<p>If I have "spun too long a yarn," the dates, at
least, will not be unacceptable to others like myself.</p>

<p>Dr. Jamieson was the first who introduced umbrellas
to Glasgow in the year 1782; he bought
his in Paris. I remember very well when this
took place. At this time the umbrella was made of
heavy wax cloth, with cane ribs, and was a ponderous article.</p>

<h4>EMANCIPATION OF THE JEWS.</h4>

<h4>(Vol. i, pp. 474, 475.)</h4>

<p>From a scarce collection of pamphlets concerning
the naturalisation of the Jews in England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>{26}</span>
published in 1753, by Dean Tucker and others,
I beg to send the following extracts, which may
be of some use in replying to the inquiry (Vol. i.,
p. 401.) respecting the Jews during the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Dean Tucker, in his <i>Second Letter to a Friend
concerning Naturalisation</i>, says (p. 29.):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The Jews having departed out of the realm in the
year 1290, or being expelled by the authority of parliament
(it matters not which), made no efforts to
return till the Protectorship of Oliver Cromwell; but
this negotiation is known to have proved unsuccessful.
However, the affair was not dropped, for the next application
was to King Charles himself, then in his exile
at Bruges, as appears by a copy of a commission dated
the 24th of September, 1656, granted to Lt.-Gen. Middleton,
to treat with the Jews of Amsterdam:&mdash;'That
whereas the Lt.-Gen. had represented to his Majesty
their good affection to him, and disowned the application
lately made to Cromwell in their behalf by some
persons of their nation, as absolutely without their
consent, the king empowers the Lt.-Gen. to treat
with them. That if in that conjunction they shall
assist his Majesty by any money, arms, or ammunition,
they shall find, when God should restore him, that he
would extend that protection to them which they could
reasonably expect, and abate that rigour of the law
which was against them in his several dominions, and repay them."
</p></blockquote>

<p>This paper, Dean Tucker says, was found
among the original papers of Sir Edward Nicholas,
Secretary of State to King Charles I. and II., and
was communicated to him by a learned and worthy
friend. The Dean goes on to remark, that the
restoration of the royal family of the Stuarts was
attended with the return of the Jews into Great
Britain; and that Lord Chancellor Clarendon
granted to many of them letters of denization under the great seal.</p>

<p>From another pamphlet in the same collection,
entitled, <i>An Answer to a Pamphlet entitled Considerations
on the Bill to permit Persons professing
the Jewish Religion to be naturalized</i>, the following, is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"There is a curious anecdote of this affair," (about
the Jews thinking Oliver Cromwell to be the Messiah,)
"in Raguenet's <i>Histoire d'Oliver Cromwell</i>, which I
will give the reader at length. About the time Rabbi
Manasseh Ben Israel came to England to solicit the
Jews' admission, the Asiatic Jews sent hither the noted
Rabbi Jacob Ben Azahel, with several others of his
nation, to make private inquiry whether Cromwell was
not that Messiah, whom they had so long expected.
(Page 33.&mdash;I leave the reader to judge what an accomplished
villain he will then be.) Which deputies upon
their arrival pretending other business, were several times
indulging the favour of a private audience from him, and
at one of them proposed buying Hebrew books and
MSS. belonging to the University of <i>Cambridge</i><a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>, in order
to have an opportunity, under pretence of viewing them,
to inquire amongst his relations, in Huntingdonshire,
where he was born, whether any of his ancestors could
be proved of Jewish extract. This project of theirs was
very readily agreed to (the University at that time being
under a cloud, on account of their former loyalty to the
King), and accordingly the ambassadors set forwards
upon their journey. But discovering by their much
longer continuance at Huntingdon than at Cambridge,
that their business at the last place was not such as was
pretended, and by not making their enquiries into
Oliver's pedigree with that caution and secresy which
was necessary in such an affair, the true purpose of
their errand into England became quickly known at
London, and was very much talked of, which causing
great scandal among the <i>Saints</i>, he was forced suddenly
to pack them out of the kingdom, without granting any of their requests."

<h2>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h2>


<p><i>Wellington, Wyrwast, and Cokam</i> (Vol. i.,
p. 401.).&mdash;The garrison in Wellington was, no
doubt, at the large house built by Sir John Topham
in that town, where the rebels, who had
gained possession of it by stratagem, held out for
some time against the king's forces under Sir
Richard Grenville. The house, though of great
strength, was much damaged on that occasion, and
shortly fell into ruin. Cokam probably designates
Colcombe Castle, a mansion of the Courtenays,
near Colyton, in Devonshire, which was occupied
by a detachment of the king's troops under Prince
Maurice in 1644, but soon after fell into the hands
of the rebels. It is now in a state of ruin, but is
in part occupied as a farm-house. I am at a loss
for <i>Wyrwast</i>, and should doubt the reading of the MS.</p>

"<i>Have</i> I wholly mistaken the whole <i>affair</i>?"
by one word, "<i>Undoubtedly</i>." The question raised
was on an Irish edition of Malone's <i>Shakspeare</i>.
Mr. Bolton Corney reproved the querists for not
consulting original sources. It appears that Mr.
Bolton Corney had not himself consulted <i>the

satisfied that he has not <i>even yet</i> seen it: and it is
not surprising if, in these circumstances, he should
have "<i>mistaken the whole affair</i>." But as my last
communication (Vol. i., p. 461.) explains (as I am
now satisfied) the blunder and its cause, I may
take my leave of the matter, only requesting Mr.
Bolton Corney, if he still doubts, to follow his own
good precept, and look at <i>the original edition</i>.</p>

<p><i>Josias Ibach Stada</i> (Vol. i., p. 452.).&mdash;In reply

hesitation in saying that Stada here is no personal
appellation at all, but the name of a town. The
inscription "<i>Fudit Josias Ibach Stada Bremensis</i>"
is to be read, Cast by Josias Ibach, <i>of the town of
Stada, in the duchy of Bremen</i>. All your readers,
particularly mercantile, will know the place well
enough from the discussions raised by Mr. Hutt,
member for Gateshead, in the House of Commons,
on the oppressive duties levied there on all vessels
and their cargoes sailing past it up the Elbe; and
to the year 1150 it was the capital of an independent
graffschaft, when it lapsed to Henry the Lion.</p>

<p><i>The Temple, or A Temple.</i>&mdash;I have had an

p. 420.), and likewise several other black-letter
editions (1523, 1561, 1587, 1598, 1602), and find
that they all agree in reading "the temple," which
Caxton's edition also adopts. The general reading
of "temple" in the <i>modern</i> editions, naturally
induced me to suspect that Tyrwhitt had made the
alteration on the authority of the manuscripts of
the poem. Of these there are no less than ten in
the British Museum, all of which have been kindly
examined for me. One of these wants the prologue,
and another that part of it in which the line
occurs; but in <i>seven</i> of the remaining eight, the reading is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"A gentil maunciple was ther of <i>a</i> temple;"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>while <i>one</i> only reads "the temple." The question,
therefore, is involved in the same doubt which I
at first stated; for the subsequent lines quoted by
P.H.F. prove nothing more than that the person
described was a manciple in <i>some</i> place of legal
resort, which was not disputed.</p>

<p><i>Bawn</i> (Vol. i., p. 440.).&mdash;If your Querist regarding
a "Bawn" will look into Macnevin's <i>Confiscation
of Ulster</i> (Duffy: Dublin, 1846, p. 171.
&amp;c.), he will find that a Bawn must have been a
sort of court-yard, which might be used on emergency
as a fortification for defence. They were
constructed either of <i>lime</i> and <i>stone</i>, of <i>stone</i> and
<i>clay</i>, or of <i>sods</i>, and twelve to fourteen feet high,
and sometimes inclosing a dwelling-house, and with the addition of "flankers."</p>

<p><i>Arabic Numerals</i>.&mdash;As your correspondent
E.V. (Vol. i., p. 230.) is desirous of obtaining any
instance of Arabic numerals of early occurrence,
I would refer him, for one at least, to <i>Notices of
the Castle and Priory of Castleacre</i>, by the Rev.
J.H. Bloom: London; Richardson, 23. Cornhill,
1843. In this work it appears that by the acumen
of Dr. Murray, Bishop of Rochester, the date 1084
was found impressed in the plaster of the wall of
the priory in the following, form:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="figure" align="center">
<tr><td align="center">1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">4 × 8</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The writer then goes on to show, that this was
the regular order of the letters to one crossing himself after the Romish fashion.</p>

<p><i>Pusan</i> (Vol. i., p. 440.)&mdash;May not the meaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>{28}</span>
be a collar in the form of a serpent? In the old
Roman de Blanchardin is this line:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Cy guer <i>pison</i> tuit Apolin."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Can <i>Iklynton</i> again be the place where such an
ornament was made? Ickleton, in Cambridgeshire,
appears to have been of some note in former
days, as, according to Lewis's <i>Topog. Hist.</i>, a nunnery
was founded there by Henry II., and a market
together with a fair granted by Henry III.
As it is only five miles from Linton, it may have
formerly borne the name of Ick-linton.</p>

<p>"<i>I'd preach as though</i>" (Vol. i., p. 415.).&mdash;The
lines quoted by Henry Martyn are said by Dr.
Jenkyn (Introduction to a little vol. of selections
from Baxter&mdash;Nelson's <i>Puritan Divines</i>) to be
Baxter's "own immortal lines." Dr. J. quotes them thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"I preached as never sure to preach again,</p>
<p>And as a dying man to dying men."</p>

<p>"<i>Fools rush in</i>" (Vol. i., p. 348.).&mdash;The line in Pope,</p>

<blockquote><p>
"For fools rush in where angels fear to tread,"
</p></blockquote>

<p>it has been long ago pointed out, is founded upon that of Shakspeare,</p>

<blockquote><p>
"For wrens make wing where eagles dare not perch."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I know not why that line of Pope is in your correspondent's
list. It is not a proverb.</p>

<p><i>Allusion in Friar Brackley's Sermon</i> (Vol. i.,
p. 351.)&mdash;It seems vain to inquire who the persons
were of whom stories were told in medieval
books, as if they were really historical. See
the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>, for instance: or consider
who the Greek king Aulix was, having dealings
with the king of Syria, in the 7th Story of the
<i>Novelle Antiche</i>. The passage in the sermon about
a Greek king, seems plainly to be still part of the
extract from the <i>Liber Decalogorum</i>, being in
Latin. This book was perhaps the <i>Dialogi
decem</i>, put into print at Cologne in 1472: Brunet.</p>

<p><i>Earwig</i> (Vol. i., p. 383.).&mdash;This insect is very
destructive to the petals of some kinds of delicate
flowers. May it not have acquired the title of
"couchbell" from its habit of couching or concealing
itself for rest at night and security from small
birds, of which it is a favourite food, in the pendent
blossoms of bell-shaped flowers? This habit is
often fatal to it in the gardens of cottagers, who
entrap it by means of a lobster's claw suspended on an upright stick.</p>

<p class="author">S.S.S.</p>


<p><i>Earwig</i> (Vol. i., p. 383.).&mdash;In the north of
England the earwig is called <i>twitchbell</i>. I know
not whether your correspondent is in error as to
its being called in Scotland the "coach-bell." I
cannot afford any explanation to either of these names.</p>

<p><i>Sir R. Haigh's Letter-book</i> (Vol. i, p. 463.).&mdash;This
is incorrect; no such person is known.
The baronet intended is <i>Sir Roger Bradshaigh,
of Haigh</i>; a very well-known person,
whose funeral sermon was preached by Wroe,
the warden of Manchester Collegiate Church,
locally remembered as "silver-mouthed Wroe."</p>

<p>This name is correctly given in Puttick and
Simpson's Catalogue of a Miscellaneous Sale on
April 15, and it is to be <i>hoped</i> that Sir Roger's
collection of letters, ranging from 1662 to 1676,
<i>may have</i> fallen into the hands of the noble earl
who represents him, the present proprietor of Haigh.</p>

<p><i>Marescautia</i> (Vol. i., p. 94.).&mdash;Your correspondent
requests some information as to the meaning
of the word "marescautia." <i>Mareschaucie</i>, in old
French, means a stable. Pasquier (<i>Recherches de
la France</i>, l. viii. ch. 2.) says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Pausanias disoit que Mark apud Celtas signifioit un
cheual ... je vous diray qu'en ancien langage allemant
Mark se prenoit pour un cheual."
</p></blockquote>

<p>In ch. 54. he refers to another etymolygy of
"maréchal," from "maire," or "maistre," and
"cheval," "comme si on les eust voulu dire maistre
de la cheualerie." "Maréchal" still signifies "a
farrier." <i>Maréchaussée</i> was the term applied
down to the Revolution to the jurisdiction of Nosseigneurs
les Maréchaux de France, whose orders
were enforced by a company of horse that patrolled
the <i>high</i>ways, la <i>chaussée</i>, generally raised
above the level of the surrounding country.
Froissart applies the term to the Marshalsea prison
in London. In D.S.'s first entry there may,
perhaps, be some allusion to another meaning of
the word, namely, that of "<i>march</i>, limit, boundary."</p>

<p>What the nature of the tenure per serjentiam
marescautiæ may be I am not prepared to say.
May it not have had some reference to the support of the royal stud?</p>

<p><i>Memoirs of an American Lady</i> (Vol. i., p. 335.).&mdash;If
this work cannot now be got it is a great
pity,&mdash;it ought to go down to posterity; a more
valuable or interesting account of a particular
state of society now quite extinct, can hardly be
found. Instead of saying that "it is the work of
Mrs. Grant, the author of this and that," I should
say of her other books that they were written by
the author of the <i>Memoirs of an American Lady</i>.
The character of the individual lady, her way of
keeping house on a large scale, the state of the
domestic slaves, threatened, as the only known
punishment and most terrible to them, with being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>{29}</span>
sold to Jamaica; the customs of the young men at
Albany, their adventurous outset in life, their
practice of robbing one another in joke (like a
curious story at Venice, in the story-book called
<i>Il Peccarone</i>, and having some connection with
the stories of the Spartan and Circassian youth),
with much of natural scenery, are told without
pretension of style; but unluckily there is too
much interspersed relating to the author herself, then quite young.</p>

<p><i>Poem by Sir E. Dyer</i> (Vol. i., p. 355.).&mdash;"My
mind to me," &amp;c. Neither the births of Breton
nor Sir Edward Dyer seem to be known; nor,
consequently, how much older the one was than
the other. Mr. S., I conclude, could not mean
much older than Breton's tract, mentioned in
Vol. i., p. 302. The poem is not in England's
<i>Helicon</i>. The ballad, as in Percy, has four stanzas
more than the present copy, and one stanza less.
Some of the readings in Percy are better, that is, more probable than the new ones.</p>

<p><i>Monumental Brasses</i>.&mdash;In reply to S.S.S.
(Vol. i., p. 405.), I beg to inform him that the
"small dog with a collar and bells" is a device of
very common occurrence on brasses of the fifteenth
and latter part of the fourteenth centuries. The
Rev. C. Boutell's <i>Monumental Brasses of England</i>
contains engravings of no less than twenty-three
on which it is to be found; as well as two examples
without the usual appendages of collar, &amp;c.
In addition to these, the same work contains etchings
of the following brasses:&mdash;Gunby, Lincoln.,
two dogs with plain collars at the bottom of the
lady's mantle, 1405. Dartmouth, Devon., 1403.
Each of the ladies here depicted has two dogs
with collars and bells at her feet.</p>

<p>The same peculiarities are exemplified on brasses
at Harpham, York., 1420; and Spilsby, Lincoln.,
1391. I will not further multiply instances, as
my own collection of rubbings would enable me to
do. I should, however, observe, that the hypothesis
of S.S.S. (as to "these figures" being
"the private mark of the artist") is untenable:
since the twenty-three examples above alluded to
are scattered over sixteen different counties, as
distant from each other as Yorkshire and Sussex.
Two examples are well known, in which the dog
so represented was a favourite animal:&mdash;Deerhurst,
Gloc., 1400, with the name, "Terri," inscribed;
and Ingham, Norfolk, 1438, with the
name "Jakke." This latter brass is now lost, but
an impression is preserved in the British Museum.
The customary explanation seems to me sufficient:
that the dog was intended to symbolise the fidelity
and attachment of the lady to her lord and master,
as the lion at <i>his</i> feet represented his courage and noble qualities.</p>

<p><i>Fenkle Street</i>.&mdash;A street so called in Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
lying in a part of the town formerly
much occupied by garden ground, and <i>in the immediate
vicinity of the house of the Dominican
Friars there</i>. Also, a way or passage inside the
town wall, and leading between that fortification
and the <i>house of the Carmelites or White Friars</i>,
was anciently called by the same name. The
name of <i>Fenkle</i> or <i>Finkle Street</i> occurs in several
old towns in the North, as Alnwick, Richmond,
York, Kendal, &amp;c. <i>Fenol</i> and <i>finugl</i>, as also <i>finul</i>,
are Saxon words for <i>fennel</i>; which, it is very probable,
has in some way or other given rise to this
name. May not the <i>monastic institutions</i> have used
fennel extensively in their culinary preparations,
and thus planted it in so great quantities as to
have induced the naming of localities therefrom?
I remember a portion of the ramparts of the town
used to be called <i>Wormwood Hill</i>, from a like circumstance.
In Hawkesworth's <i>Voyages</i>, ii. 8., I
find it stated that the town of Funchala, on the
island of Madeira, derives its name from <i>Funcko</i>,
the Portuguese name for <i>fennel</i>, which grows in
great plenty upon the neighbouring rocks. The
priory of Finchale (from <i>Finkel</i>), upon the Wear,
probably has a similar origin; <i>sed qu.</i></p>

<p><i>Christian Captives</i> (Vol. i., p. 441.)&mdash;In reply to

Society, vol. i. p. 98., the following entries
extracted from the Parish Registers of Great Dunham, Norfolk:&mdash;</p>

to have been made by special mandate, and paid
into the hands of the proper authorities.</p>

<p><i>Passage in Gibbon</i> (Vol. i., p. 348.).&mdash;The
passage in Gibbon I should have thought was
well known to be taken from what Clarendon
says of Hampden, and which Lord Nugent says
in his preface to <i>Hampden's Life</i> had before been
said of Cinna. Gibbon must either have meant to
put inverted commas, or at least to have intended to take nobody in.</p>

<p><i>Borrowed Thoughts</i> (Vol. i., p. 482.)&mdash;<i>La fameuse</i>
La Galisse is an error. The French pleasantly

poems are borrowed from the French.</p>

<p><i>Sapcote Motto</i> (Vol. i., pp. 366. and 476.).&mdash;Taking
for granted that solutions of the "Sapcote
Motto" are scarce, I send you what seems to me
something nearer the truth than the arbitrary and
unsatisfactory translation of T.C. (Vol. i, p. 476.).</p>

<p>The motto stands thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"sco toot × vinic [or umic]</p>
<p class="i4">× poncs."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Adopting T.C.'s suggestion that the initial
and final <i>s</i> are mere flourishes (though that makes
little difference), and also his supposition that <i>c</i>
may have been used for <i>s</i>, and as I fancy, not
unreasonably conjecturing that the × is intended
for <i>dis</i>, which is something like the pronunciation
of the numeral X, we may then take the <i>entire</i>
motto, without garbling it, and have sounds representing
<i>que toute disunis dispenses</i>; which, grammatically
and orthographically corrected, would
read literally "all disunions cost," or "destroy,"
the equivalent of our "Union is strength." The
motto, with the arms, three dove-cotes, is admirably suggestive of family union.</p>

<p><i>Lines attributed to Lord Palmerston</i> (Vol. i.,
p. 382.).&mdash;These lines have also been attributed to Mason.</p>

<p class="author">S.S.S.</p>


<p><i>Shipster</i> (Vol. i., p. 339.).&mdash;That "ster" is a feminine
termination is the notion of Tyrwhitt in a
note upon Hoppesteris in a passage of Chaucer
(<i>Knight's Tale</i>, l. 2019.); but to ignorant persons
it seems not very probable. "Maltster," surely, is
not feminine, still less "whipster;" "dempster,"
Scotch, is a judge. Sempstress has another termination
on purpose to make it feminine.</p>

<p>I wish we had a dictionary, like that of Hoogeven
for Greek, arranging words according to their terminations.</p>

<h2>Miscellanies.</h2>


<p><i>Blue Boar Inn, Holborn</i>.&mdash;The reviewer in the
last "Quarterly" of Mr. Cunningham's <i>Handbook
for London</i>, makes an error in reference to the
extract from Morrice's <i>Life of Lord Orrery</i>, given
by Mr. Cunningham under the head of "Blue
Boar Inn, Holborn," and transcribed by the reviewer
(<i>Qu. Rev.</i> vol. lxxxvi., p. 474.). Morrice,
Lord Orrery's biographer, relates a story which he
says Lord Orrery had told him, that he had been
told by Cromwell and Ireton of their intercepting
a letter from Charles I. to his wife, which was sewn
up in the skirt of a saddle. The story may or may
not be true; this authority for it is not first-rate.
The Quarterly reviewer, in transcribing from Mr.
Cunningham's book the passage in Morrice's <i>Life
of Lord Orrery</i>, introduces it by saying,&mdash;"Cromwell,
in a letter to Lord Broghill, narrates circumstantially
how he and Ireton intercept, &amp;c."
This is a mistake; there is no letter from Cromwell
to Lord Broghill on the subject. (Lord Broghill
was Earl of Orrery after the Restoration.) Such
a letter would be excellent authority for the story.
The mistake, which is the Quarterly reviewer's,
and not Mr. Cunningham's, is of some importance.</p>

<p><i>Lady Morgan and Curry</i>.&mdash;An anecdote in the
last number of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, p. 477.,
"this is the first set down you have given me to-day,"
reminds me of an incident in Dublin society
some quarter of a century ago or more. The
good-humoured and accomplished&mdash;Curry
(shame to me to have forgotten his christened
name for the moment!) had been engaged in a
contest of wit with Lady Morgan and another
female <i>célébrité</i>, in which Curry had rather the
worst of it. It was the fashion then for ladies to
wear very short sleeves; and Lady Morgan, albeit
not a young woman, with true provincial exaggeration,
wore none, a mere strap over her shoulders.
Curry was walking away from her little coterie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>{31}</span>
when she called out, "Ah! come back Mr. Curry,
and acknowledge that you are fairly beaten."
"At any rate," said he, turning round, "I have
this consolation, you can't laugh at me in your sleeve!"</p>

<p><i>Sir Walter Scott and Erasmus</i>.&mdash;Has it yet
been noticed that the picture of German manners
in the middle ages given by Sir W. Scott, in his
<i>Anne of Geierstein</i> (chap. xix.), is taken (in some
parts almost verbally) from Erasmus' dialogue,
<i>Diversoria</i>? Although Sir Walter mentions Erasmus
at the beginning of the chapter, he is totally
silent as to any hints he may have got from him;
neither do the notes to my copy of his works at all allude to this circumstance.</p>

<p><i>Parallel Passages</i>.&mdash;A correspondent in Vol. i.,
p. 330, quoted some parallels to a passage in
Shakspeare's <i>Julius Cæsar</i>. Will you allow me
to add another, I think even more striking than
those he cited. The full passage in Shakspeare is,</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"There is a tide in the affairs of man,</p>
<p>Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune.</p>
<p>Omitted, all the voyage of their lives</p>
<p>Is bound in shallows and in miseries."</p>

<p>In Bacon's <i>Advancement of Learning</i>, book 2, occurs the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"In the third place, I set down reputation because
of the peremptory tides and currents it hath, which,
if they be not taken in due time, are seldom recovered,
it being extreme hard to play an after game of reputation."

<p><i>Gray's Ode</i>.&mdash;In return for the information
about Gray's <i>Ode</i>, I send an entertaining and very
characteristic circumstance told in Mrs. Bigg's
(anonymous) <i>Residence in France</i> (edited by Gifford):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"She had a copy of Gray when she was arrested in
the Reign of Terror. The Jacobins who searched her
goods lighted on the line&mdash;

and said, 'Apparemment ce livre est quelque chose de
fanatique.'"

<p>My informant tells me that the monk he saw
was the same as the one mentioned by your correspondent,
and that he had a motto from Lord Bacon over his cell.</p>

<p><i>The Grand Style</i>.&mdash;Is it not extremely probable
that Bonaparte plagiarised the idea of the centuries
observing the French army from the pyramids from these lines of Lucan?&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<i>Sæcula</i> Romanos nunquam tacitura labore,
<i>Attendunt, oevumque sequens speculatur</i> ab omni
Orbe ratem."&mdash;<i>Phars.</i> viii. 622.
</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the recent French revolutionists (I think
Rollin) compared himself with the victim of Calvary.
Even this profane rant is a plagiarism.
Gracchus Baboeuf, who headed the extreme republican
party against the Directory, exclaimed,
on his trial, that his wife, and those of his fellow-conspirators,
"should accompany them <i>even to
Calvary</i>, because the cause of their punishment
should not bring them to shame."&mdash;<i>Mignet's French Revolution</i>, chap. xii.</p>

<p><i>Hoppesteris</i>.&mdash;The "shippis <i>hoppesteris</i>," in
Chaucer's <i>Knight's Tale</i>, 2019., is explained by
Tyrwhitt to mean <i>dancing</i>, and that in the feminine&mdash;a
very odd epithet. He tells us that the
corresponding epithet in Boccaccio is <i>bellatrici</i>.
I have no doubt that Chaucer mistook it for <i>ballatrici</i>.</p>

<p class="author">C.B.</p>


<p><i>Sheridan's Last Residence</i> (Vol. i., p. 484.).&mdash;I
wonder at any doubt about poor Sheridan's having
died in his own house, 17. Saville Row. His remains,
indeed, were removed (I believe for prudential
reasons which I need not specify) to Mr.
Peter Moore's, in Great George Street; but he
was never more than a temporary, though frequent visitor at Mr. Moore's.</p>

<p>The Devices and Mottoes of the later Middle Ages

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
